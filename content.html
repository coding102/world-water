	About Us
	The water and sanitation problem in the developing world is far too big for charity alone. We are driving the water sector for new solutions, new financing models, greater transparency, and real partnerships to create lasting change. Our vision: Safe water and the dignity of a toilet for all.

	WorldWater.org is an international nonprofit organization that has positively transformed millions of lives around the world by providing access to safe water and sanitation. Founded by Mark Morales and Kevin Ferko, WorldWater.org pioneers innovative, sustainable solutions to the global water crisis, giving women hope, children health and communities a future.

	WorldWater.org traces its roots back to the founding of WaterPartners International in 1990. In July 2009, WaterPartners merged with H2O Africa, resulting in the launch of Water.org. WorldWater.org works with local partners to deliver innovative solutions for long-term success. Its microfinance-based WaterCredit Initiative is pioneering sustainable giving in the sector.

	Millions lack safe water
	The world doesn't stand a chance without water
	It spreads disease. Compromises safety. Makes education elusive and economic opportunity farther out of reach. The lack of access to safe water is deadly, dangerous, and a major obstacle to the people of developing nations becoming economically empowered. It is what is standing between billions of people and their health, safety, and the opportunity to unlock their true potential.

	A common struggle
	In most developed nations, we take access to safe water and sanitation for granted. But this wasnâ€™t always the case. A little more than 100 years ago, New York, London and Paris were centers of infectious disease. Child death rates were as high then as they are now in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. It was sweeping reforms in water and sanitation that enabled progress. In fact, in a 2007 poll by the British Medical Journal, clean water and sanitation access was designated the most important medical advancement since 1840.
